## What I do 
I study computer science at Portland State University. I work full time as a paralegal. 

## My favorite things
My dog, Samson. He looks like a little cow. :cow2:

## Stuff
I love hiking, backingpacking, camping and outdoorsy stuff. 
I love engaging with intelligent people with whom I can collaborate and learn from (all of you at Write the Docs!).
