# Shrie: a quasi-summary


## A bit about me

I'm a tech writer, avid reader, journaler, record collector, and peer-pressurer living in sunny Austin, TX.


## Things I like

I like some things, including but not limited to:

* Hanging with puppies and kitties
* Flying kites in the sunshine
* Eating nachos and burritos
* Picking through dusty record bins
* Cultivating my square foot garden
* Going on swim-ventures
* Reading literary fiction
* Slowly peddling my bike on roads and trails
